### A Slack conversational bot for scheduling and monitoring meetings

#### Just an attempt to write a conversational interface for scheduling and monitoring time spent in meetings.

I intend to focus on analyzing the time spent and other issues related to meetings, scheduling is just a hook. It's incredibly hard to do dialog based scheduling.

###### Have used SuTime from StanfordCoreNLP and the respective Python wrapper
